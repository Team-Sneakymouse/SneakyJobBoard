## The block coordinates of the central point on the map itemframe. Used to determine itemsdisplay positions
## The scale, rotation and facing of the map itemframe are determined automatically
## The fifth optional boolean can be used to make a board non-interactable: It will show icons, but will not open the job board UI when right-clicked
## The sixth optional integer is a scale override. This can be used when you use something other than a standard minecraft map, such as an ImageFrame
## The seventh optional double can be used to add an isometric angle to the map, for when you are using an imageframe of an isometric projection. This is the angle between the projected Y and projected X, or projected Y and projected Z axis.
## This is a string list, and can support multiple boards at once
map-central-vectors:
    - world,0,0,0
    - world,0,0,0,FALSE
    - world,0,0,0,FALSE,128
    - world,0,0,0,FALSE,128,62.5

## The world block coordinates that are represented by the map-central-vectors.
## This is a string list, in case different boards have different maps on them. But if a board does not have a matching world vector, it will use the last vector on the list.
